# ML-Classification-Analysis

## Project Overview
The "ML-Classification-Analysis" project is focused on applying various machine learning classification models to a chosen dataset. The aim is to explore, analyze, and predict outcomes based on the dataset's features using different classification techniques. This project encompasses data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation.

## Dataset Description
The project utilizes the Ames Housing dataset, sourced from Kaggle. This dataset serves as an excellent alternative to the older but popular Boston Housing dataset. It was compiled by Dean De Cock in 2011, specifically for use in data science education.
### Key Characteristics:
- **Source**: Kaggle (Ames Housing Dataset)
- **Content**: The dataset contains 79 explanatory variables that describe almost every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa. These features encompass a wide range of information, including the type of dwelling, lot size, quality and condition, year built, and various other characteristics of the house.
- **Target Variable**: The primary objective is to predict the selling price of the houses, making this a regression problem.
- **Inspiration**: The dataset is primarily used for regression tasks, with a focus on predicting house prices based on a comprehensive set of features.

## Key Objectives
- To perform comprehensive EDA to understand the dataset's features and relationships.
- To preprocess the data, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
- To apply various classification models and evaluate their performance.
- To fine-tune the models using techniques like Grid Search or Randomized Search.
- To select the best model based on performance metrics.

## Methodology
### Data Preprocessing
The data preprocessing stage involved several crucial steps to prepare the Ames Housing dataset for effective modeling. Key steps included:

- **Handling Missing Values**: We identified missing data within the dataset and employed strategies such as imputation and removal of features with a high percentage of missing values to address them.
- **Feature Encoding**: Categorical variables in the dataset were converted into numerical format using techniques like one-hot encoding. This step is essential for allowing machine learning algorithms to process the data.
- **Feature Scaling**: Numerical features were scaled to ensure they were on the same scale. This is particularly important for models sensitive to the magnitude of features, such as Support Vector Machines and K-Nearest Neighbors.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
The EDA phase provided deep insights into the dataset and informed subsequent modeling decisions. Key aspects of our EDA included:

- **Statistical Summary**: We began with a statistical overview of the dataset, examining measures such as mean, median, and standard deviation across different features.
- **Target Variable Analysis**: The distribution of the target variable, 'Sale Price', was analyzed to understand its range and central tendencies.
- **Correlation Analysis**: We investigated correlations between features using heatmaps to identify potential predictors for the target variable and to detect multicollinearity.
- **Visual Exploration**: Various visualizations were employed to explore relationships between features. This included scatter plots for numerical features, box plots for categorical features, and histograms to understand feature distributions.
- **Outliers Detection**: We identified and analyzed outliers within the dataset, which can significantly impact model performance.
- **Feature Relationships**: The relationships between different features and the target variable were explored to understand the dynamics influencing house prices.

These EDA steps provided a comprehensive understanding of the dataset's characteristics, guiding our approach to feature engineering and model selection.


### Model Building and Evaluation
In this phase, we built and evaluated a range of machine learning models to predict house prices. The selection of models was based on their ability to handle regression tasks and their varying approaches to learning from data. The models included:

- Linear Models (Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso): These models provide a baseline for performance and are effective for understanding linear relationships.
- Tree-Based Models (Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting): Known for handling non-linearity and feature interactions effectively.
- Support Vector Regressor (SVR): Useful for capturing complex relationships in data.
- K-Nearest Neighbors: A simple, distance-based approach to regression.
- XGBoost: An advanced implementation of gradient boosting known for its performance and speed.

We used several metrics for model evaluation, including Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE), to assess model accuracy and error characteristics.

### Hyperparameter Tuning
To optimize model performance, we employed hyperparameter tuning techniques. Specifically, we used Grid Search CV for the XGBoost model, systematically exploring combinations of parameters to find the most effective settings. Key parameters included `n_estimators`, `learning_rate`, `max_depth`, `subsample`, and `colsample_bytree`. The best parameters were determined based on the negative mean squared error metric, ensuring the selection of parameters that minimize prediction error.

### Results
The model evaluations revealed that the XGBoost model, with its fine-tuned parameters, outperformed other models in terms of MSE, RMSE, and MAE. This indicates its strong predictive power and ability to generalize well to unseen data. The final model was then used to make predictions on the test set, providing an assessment of its real-world applicability.

Key insights from the project include the effectiveness of ensemble methods like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting in handling complex datasets, and the importance of hyperparameter tuning in enhancing model performance. The project demonstrated the value of a systematic approach to model selection and evaluation in achieving high-quality predictions.
